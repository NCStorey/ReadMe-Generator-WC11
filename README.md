# README Generator - WC11

## Description

It is a very rare person who enjoys making README's. This repo of code aims to take away some of the pain when creating them by having the template ready to go.
README's are crucial to a third party being able to understand someones code and it is the hope that taking some of the load of off the user they are more likely to have complete and detailed notes.

Using the inquirer node module the user is asked a series of question and on completion their answers are used to build the README. The README will still need some 
finishing touches like screenshots but it gets the user 70% of the way their.

The reason it was undertaken was under the instruction of Trilogy Education for their weekly challenge (number 11). 

## Installation

This repo require Node JS. It uses both the Inquirer and FS modules.

## Usage
